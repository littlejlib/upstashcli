/** The folder both machines already have mounted, used as the route for anything too big to push
 *  through a message relay.
 *  <p>
 *  Only the RELATIVE path travels on the wire. The two machines mount the same synced folder at
 *  different absolute paths - that is the normal case with Google Drive, where one end is a letter
 *  drive and the other is under a home directory - so an absolute path from the sender would be
 *  meaningless at the receiver.
 *  <p>
 *  Arrival is decided by the digest, not by the file appearing. A sync product writes the file over
 *  some seconds and gives no signal when it has finished, and a sidecar marker is no help because
 *  nothing guarantees it syncs after the payload. Size first because it is free, then SHA-256. */
