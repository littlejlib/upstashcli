/** How a file gets from one end to the other, and the reasoning made explicit.
 *  <p>
 *  Three ways, cheapest first. Two ends on one machine share a filesystem, so there is nothing to
 *  transfer and the far end simply copies. A small file goes through the relay as encrypted chunks.
 *  A large one goes through a folder both machines already have mounted - a synced Google Drive
 *  folder is what that is for - because a hundred megabytes of base64 through a metered message bus
 *  is an abuse of the message bus and a month's command allowance.
 *  <p>
 *  Strings rather than an enum for the same reason {@link littlejlib.upstashcli.record.Streams} is:
 *  these names go on the wire and into recordings, where outliving a code change is worth more
 *  than a compile-time check. */
