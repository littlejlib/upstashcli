/** A channel into someone's machine that never closes itself is a backdoor whatever it was built
 *  for, so a shared session ends on its own: after fifteen quiet minutes, and after four hours
 *  whatever is happening. Both numbers are settings.
 *  <p>
 *  A LOCAL-ONLY session is exempt, deliberately. Nothing about it is reachable from off this
 *  machine - no relay, no announcement, no credentials read - so there is no remote party whose
 *  access needs a time limit, and an agent's console has every right to sit untouched while the
 *  agent thinks. Expiring those would be a mystifying failure bought for no safety at all.
 *  <p>
 *  Output alone does not count as activity. A runaway process printing to a shared shell must not
 *  be able to hold a remote channel open for ever; a job actually running does count, so a build
 *  someone started and is waiting on is not cut off underneath them. */
