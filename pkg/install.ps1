# upstashcli installer.
#
# It does two things, and neither can be done by unzipping:
#
#   1. Rewrites the two .jrc files to name the jars by ABSOLUTE path. jr.exe finds its .jrc beside
#      itself whatever directory you are standing in, but it hands the -jar path to the JVM
#      untouched - so a relative one is resolved against the CURRENT directory. Double-clicking the
#      window from Explorer happens to work, because Explorer sets the current directory to the
#      folder; running "upstashcli" from a terminal anywhere else fails with "Unable to access
#      jarfile". That difference is exactly the kind that gets reported as "it works for me".
#
#   2. Adds this folder to the current user's PATH, so "upstashcli" is a command.
#
# Re-running is safe, and moving the folder and running it again re-points everything.
#
#   install.cmd              install

#   install.cmd -NoShortcut  do not put a shortcut on the desktop
#   install.cmd -NoPause     do not wait for a keypress (for scripts)
