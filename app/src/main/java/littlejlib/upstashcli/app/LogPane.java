/** What the tool did, kept out of the terminal.
 *  <p>
 *  The two belong on different channels and the reason is not tidiness. A terminal is a byte
 *  stream a program is drawing on: a line of ours written into it lands in the middle of whatever
 *  was being drawn, survives into any transcript taken from that screen, and cannot be told apart
 *  from the program's own output by anything downstream. So the shell gets the terminal, and
 *  everything about the shell - a command an agent ran, a viewer arriving, a refusal - comes here.
 *  <p>
 *  Hidden by default and toggled with one key, because most of the time there is nothing to read;
 *  the legend says how many lines arrived while it was shut, so nothing happens unannounced. */
