/** Which rendezvous this machine uses, and how to point it at a different one.
 *  <p>
 *  This exists so that rotating a credential is a thing you can ask a person to do. A distributed
 *  copy is shipped with the credential already in its settings.toml, which means every machine that
 *  copy reached is on the same relay account for as long as that account exists - and the only way
 *  to move one of them used to be to talk whoever is at the keyboard through editing three lines of
 *  TOML. That is not a rotation plan. It is also where a Windows path in double quotes turns every
 *  backslash into an escape and the node then refuses to start at all.
 *  <p>
 *  So: one command, given a file. "Rotate the credential" is only a real answer if the doing of it
 *  is one step. */
