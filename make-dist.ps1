# Assemble the distributable: dist/upstashcli/ plus a zip of it.
#
# Everything that is not a jar lives in pkg/ and is version-controlled. The two launchers are
# copies of jr.exe under different names, taken at package time rather than committed, because a
# binary in the repo goes stale silently and jr is its own project.
#
# The settings.toml staged here has its three credential lines EMPTY, and pkg/ holds it under
# settings.toml.template so that .gitignore can go on refusing anything actually named
# settings.toml. That is what makes this zip publishable: it carries the software and no secret.
# Joining a relay is a separate step the recipient does once, in the window or with "relay set".
#
#   .\make-dist.ps1              package from the jars already built
#   .\make-dist.ps1 -Build       run the maven build first
