/** The session id and its one-time password as one string, so inviting somebody is one copy and
 *  one paste rather than two of each.
 *  <p>
 *  Two fixed-width fields make this unambiguous without a separator surviving the trip: the id is
 *  nine digits and the password is eight characters of {@link Ids#PASSWORD_ALPHABET}, so seventeen
 *  alphanumerics split at nine every time. {@link Ids#normalise} already throws away everything
 *  else, which means the dashes and spaces are decoration - they help a person read it aloud and
 *  cost nothing when it is pasted back with the formatting mangled by whatever carried it.
 *  <p>
 *  Handing both halves over together is a deliberate choice and not a shortcut. The password is
 *  what authenticates the key exchange, so it is not a second factor guarding the first; the actual
 *  gate is that the person at the far keyboard is asked to approve the viewer, and they are asked
 *  whatever the password did. Two strings to copy bought nothing and lost people halfway. */
